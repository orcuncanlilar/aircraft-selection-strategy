# Turkish Delight Airlines Aircraft Analysis

## Business Understanding

"Turkish Delight Airlines," is expanding into the aviation industry with the goal of operating both commercial and private aircraft, primarily focusing on routes between Turkey and the USA. The company’s leadership is unfamiliar with the risks associated with aircraft operations and is seeking data-driven insights to make informed decisions on which aircraft models to purchase for safe and efficient operations.

## Data Understanding



### Data Preparation



## Exploratory Data Analysis



## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, here are the recommendations for Turkish Delight Airlines when choosing aircraft models for their operations:

1. Prioritize Safety through Pilot Training and Automation: Focus on aircraft that incorporate advanced automation and safety systems to reduce pilot error, which is the leading cause of accidents. Aircraft with advanced avionics and autopilot features, such as those from Boeing or Airbus, should be prioritized to minimize human error.

2. Select Aircraft with Lower Mechanical Failure Rates: Choose models with a proven record of mechanical reliability, particularly for long-haul flights. Aircraft with higher mechanical failure records should be avoided or used on shorter, less critical routes.

3. Choose Aircraft Equipped for Adverse Weather Conditions:  Consider aircraft models with advanced weather detection and navigation systems. These should be particularly important for routes between Turkey and the USA, where weather can be a factor.

4. Minimize Injury Risk by Selecting Aircraft with Low Injury Rates: Focus on aircraft with historically low injury rates based on the weighted injury score analysis.

5. Use 'Days Since Last Accident' as a Key Metric for Reliability: Prefer aircraft models that show long periods between accidents. Avoid models with frequent accidents or those that have had recent incidents.

6. Number of Engines for Optimal Efficiency and Safety: Two-engine aircraft should be prioritized for long-haul flights between Turkey and the USA. These aircraft are more fuel-efficient and provide sufficient engine redundancy for safe operation.


### Next Steps

1. Perform a Detailed Risk Assessment: Conduct a thorough risk assessment that includes an analysis of both historical accident data and predictive models based on current operational conditions, routes, and market demands. Consider the specific risks of operating international flights between Turkey and the USA, such as weather patterns, regulatory differences, and air traffic.
   
2. Integrate Newer Technologies: Evaluate the latest aircraft models that incorporate advanced safety, fuel efficiency, and environmental sustainability features. Invest in modern technology that can provide both short-term safety benefits and long-term operational efficiency. 

3. Pilot Training and Safety Protocols: Develop a comprehensive training program for pilots and crew that emphasizes error prevention, emergency handling, and use of advanced avionics systems. Implement a standardized protocol for responding to mechanical failures and adverse weather conditions.

4. Standardize Maintenance Protocols: Establish rigorous maintenance and inspection schedules based on manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements. Use predictive maintenance technologies to identify potential issues before they result in accidents

5. Leverage Data for Continuous Improvement: Implement a robust data analytics platform to track and analyze flight performance, accident reports, and maintenance records in real-time.
